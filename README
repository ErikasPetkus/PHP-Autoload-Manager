                         AutoLoad Manager
                         ================

Cms AutoLoad Manager is a generic autoloader that can be used with any
framework or library.

Using the PHP tokenizer mechanism, it will parse folder(s) and discover
the different classes and interfaces defined.

The big advantage of using this autoloadManager is that it will allow
you to implement whatever naming rules you want and may have mutliple
classes in one file (if you want to have a such feature).

There are two main features offered by this script : 

1. Register the loadClass function:
        spl_autoload_register('autoloadManager::loadClass');

2. Add a folder to process: 
        autoloadManager::addFolder('{YOUR_FOLDER_PATH}');
